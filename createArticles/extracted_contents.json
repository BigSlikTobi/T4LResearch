  "6": "Pete Carroll: Too early to say if Russell Wilson is option for Raiders at quarterback\nPublished: Jan 29, 2025 at 08:29 AM\nKevin Patra Senior News Writer\nWith the glaring need at quarterback in Las Vegas, the immediate dot-connecting when the Raiders hired Pete Carroll suggested his former Seahawks signal-caller Russell Wilson could follow. Wilson, a soon-to-be free agent, has said his desire is to remain in Pittsburgh, but Carroll's hire in Vegas could change the calculus.\nCarroll was asked on the \"What the Football with Suzy Shuster & Amy Trask\" podcast whether a reunion with Wilson could be in the works. The 73-year-old coach said it was too soon in the process for such thoughts. \"It's so early, and we're just in the midst of trying to find the puzzle pieces. We're not even putting them together yet, so I can't even say,\" Carroll said. \"Free agency hasn't come yet. That's the first competitive opportunity that will occur. Then, the draft is coming. We'll have that opportunity. I can't tell you right now. I could guess, but it would just be a guess.\"\nPete Carroll to build Raiders around QB position with Tom Brady's insight: 'We happen to have the greatest of all time to help us' Daniel Jeremiah 2025 NFL mock draft 1.0: Titans boost defense with first pick; Giants, Raiders select QBs Raiders hire Buccaneers assistant GM John Spytek as new general manager\nThe coach and QB spent 10 seasons together in Seattle, winning a Super Bowl together. The relationship ended rocky, with the two sniping in the season after Wilson was traded to Denver. However, the two seem to have made amends since.\nWilson could be a possibility in Vegas, but Carroll isn't ruling out anyone who could help the Raiders turn things around. \"I promise you, if you're a real competitor, you're not letting options get away from you,\" Carroll said. \"So we're going to consider every option as a possibility, and we'll go after it very aggressively, with intent, and hopefully with a sense and a feeling that people want to be part of this thing.\"\nGardner Minshew and Aidan O'Connell are currently on the roster but were acquired by previous administrations. Vegas also holds the No. 6 overall pick that it could use to draft a QB or for a potential trade-up for one of the top signal-callers in the 2025 NFL Draft.\nMatt Eberflus on focus of 2025 Cowboys defense: 'We will take the ball away' Panthers re-sign backup QB Andy Dalton to two-year deal NFL news roundup: Saints hiring Scott Tolzien as QBs coach; Bengals extend P Ryan Rehkow Lions offensive coordinator John Morton to lean on Jared Goff: 'It all starts with the quarterback' Cam Ward's message to NFL teams: 'If you don't draft me, that's your fault ... and I'll remember that' 2025 NFL franchise tag window opens today Ravens OL Ben Cleveland arrested, cited for DUI on Feb. 12 Bengals focused on signing Tee Higgins to long-term deal; likely to use second franchise tag if needed Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence 'happy here in Jacksonville,' dismisses trade rumors: 'Not going to Pittsburgh' NFL news roundup: Jaguars sign rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit to active roster; Raiders part ways with assistant GM Champ Kelly Cowboys' Micah Parsons: Learning a third defense is 'challenging' but 'that's part of being a pro' Eagles OT Lane Johnson 'looking forward to many more years to come' in Philadelphia",
  "7": "Cowboys QB Dak Prescott: Brian Schottenheimer is 'tied directly to my future'\nPublished: Jan 29, 2025 at 07:33 AM\nKevin Patra Senior News Writer\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\nDak Prescott made sure to attend Brian Schottenheimer's introductory press conference on Monday after his offensive coordinator was elevated to head coach. Prescott knows that if he's to have any on-field prosperity, the new Dallas Cowboys coach must be successful. 'I mean, Shotty means a lot to me,' the QB said, via the team's official website. 'He's been a consistent man, and I think that's a part of why he's gotten this job in his time being here. So somebody that shows you the character that is consistent with what they do, that is supportive to me. Anything that has happened to me these three years on the field or off the field, I got a message or check-in on that. 'Yeah, just wanted to go support him. One, proud of him, proud of taking advantage of this opportunity, and two, I know the approach he's going to have. I wanted to show him, hey, I'm going to be here with you and for you. Not only, what, he signs for four years? I got four years left on my contract. He's tied directly to my future, so let's go be the best that we can in these four years.'\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones on hiring Brian Schottenheimer as HC: 'This is as big a risk as you can take' Cowboys hire offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer as next head coach Cowboys hire ex-Bears HC Matt Eberflus as new defensive coordinator\nSchottenheimer went from Cowboys coaching analyst in 2022 to offensive coordinator in 2023 and 2024 before being handed the head coaching gig after Mike McCarthy and the club couldn't agree on a contract. Prescott noted that one key in the longtime assistant coach getting the top job after 26 seasons in the NFL was the desire for 'continuity.' 'The simple conversation I had with (owner) Jerry (Jones), post the decision of Mike walking, was simply that, the continuity,' Prescott said. 'They wanted to keep continuity. Obviously had a lot of success with this group, with these men, and knew this was important to me. And Shotty has been a huge factor in that, setting up the game plan, creating the game plan. 'If you wanted to find continuity in place, look no further than Shotty.'\nHopefully, for Prescott, that continuity doesn't extend to postseason failures. In 25 starts over two seasons since Schottenheimer took over as OC, Prescott completed 67.9 percent of his passes for 6,494 yards with 47 touchdowns and 17 interceptions.\nDuring that introductory press conference, Jones noted it was as 'big a risk as you can take' in hiring Schottenheimer. That admission underscores trepidation from the fan base and onlookers to get behind the hire. At least for Prescott, there aren't concerns about Schottenheimer's ability to lead. 'Oh yeah, he's going to command the team. He's going to galvanize more than just the offense,' Dak said. 'The special teams, the defense, everybody will have the same message. You'll be on the same accord. I think everybody will have clear job responsibilities, something I think he said up there. And from there, he will hold everybody accountable, and not only that, he expects everybody to hold him accountable to that, to those communications. 'That alone has me excited. And understand, that's where you are going to get continuity, but yet the change we're looking for.'\nIf Prescott doesn't stay healthy and return to his 2023 form, all the continuity in the world won't matter in Dallas.\nMatt Eberflus on focus of 2025 Cowboys defense: 'We will take the ball away' Panthers re-sign backup QB Andy Dalton to two-year deal NFL news roundup: Saints hiring Scott Tolzien as QBs coach; Bengals extend P Ryan Rehkow Lions offensive coordinator John Morton to lean on Jared Goff: 'It all starts with the quarterback' Cam Ward's message to NFL teams: 'If you don't draft me, that's your fault ... and I'll remember that' 2025 NFL franchise tag window opens today Ravens OL Ben Cleveland arrested, cited for DUI on Feb. 12 Bengals focused on signing Tee Higgins to long-term deal; likely to use second franchise tag if needed Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence 'happy here in Jacksonville,' dismisses trade rumors: 'Not going to Pittsburgh' NFL news roundup: Jaguars sign rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit to active roster; Raiders part ways with assistant GM Champ Kelly Cowboys' Micah Parsons: Learning a third defense is 'challenging' but 'that's part of being a pro' Eagles OT Lane Johnson 'looking forward to many more years to come' in Philadelphia",

The question is whether one of them will be the all-important QB.\nNew York's predicament, coupled with other QB-needy teams like the Raiders, Jets, Saints, etc., is why signal-callers are destined to be pushed up during the draft process.\nWhile Ward and Sanders might remain the clear-cut top two, quarterbacks like Jaxson Dart, Jalen Milroe, Kyle McCord, and others, will be heavily discussed and dissected as Draft Season unfolds.\nThe browser you are using is no longer supported on this site.

The [coaching change](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/www.nfl.com/news/mike-mccarthy-will-not-return-as-cowboys-hc-as-sides-could-not-agree-on-new-deal>) in Dallas pushed Mike Zimmer out after one season, with coach Brian Schottenheimer [hiring](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/www.nfl.com/news/cowboys-to-hire-ex-bears-hc-matt-eberflus-as-new-defensive-coordinator>) former Chicago Bears coach Matt Eberflus as his new defensive coordinator. For Parsons, who played his first three seasons under Dan Quinn, getting to know a third scheme is the most challenging part of the offseason overhaul. \\\"It\\'s just learning a new system and getting another coach\\'s adjustments to how I like to play, what I like to do\u2026 and implicate me,\\\" Parsons said last week, [via the team\\'s official website](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/www.dallascowboys.com/news/micah-parsons-opens-up-about-cowboys-coaching-changes-offseason-plan-of-attack>). \\\"Obviously, it is challenging with a third [defensive coordinator] and [another change] is obviously not the greatest thing in the world but, I mean, that\\'s part of being a pro. You\\'ve got to make adjustments.\\\"\nChange came semi-slow last season, with Parsons netting one sack in his first four games under Zimmer. An injury then wiped out a quartet of tilts. Upon his return, however, Parsons dominated, generating 11 sacks in the final nine games. He also earned 49 QB pressures after returning, per PFF. Once Parsons was immersed into the scheme, there was no better defender in football down the stretch.\nThe key for Dallas in 2025 will be Eberflus unleashing Parsons from the jump. Things didn\\'t go well in Chicago, but few should question Eberflus\\' ability to scheme a defense. Parsons can thrive in any system, so the transition for the star player is less of a concern than the defensive holes surrounding him in 2025.\nParsons noted that he hopes to add power to his game this offseason. \\\"I wanna get a little stronger,\\\" he said. \\\"I get a little more powerful. There are some things that I wanna work on that I\\'m implementing into my offseason program. I always try to ask some new things, so I\\'m gonna try to bring back a little bit more power.\\\"\nThe first order of business for the Cowboys is inking Parsons to a long-term deal to [ensure](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/www.nfl.com/news/stephen-jones-can-t-imagine-seeing-micah-parsons-play-elsewhere-as-cowboys-enter-crucial-2025-offseason>) he\\'s in Dallas well beyond the 2025 changes.\n##  Related Content [ ![](https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/league/z9lur6t6wzsomdailhit.jpg) news  Matt Eberflus on focus of 2025 Cowboys defense: \\'We will take the ball away\\'  Addressing reporters Tuesday, former Chicago Bears head coach and new Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus forecast an exciting and opportunistic unit. ](https://www.nfl.com/news/</news/matt-eberflus-on-focus-of-2025-cowboys-defense-we-will-take-the-ball-away> \\\"Matt Eberflus on focus of 2025 Cowboys defense: \\'We will take the ball away\\'\\\") [ ![](https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/league/byb6lyjwogjmei7zo441.jpg) news  Panthers re-sign backup QB Andy Dalton to two-year deal  Veteran quarterback Andy Dalton is returning to the Panthers on a two-year deal, the team announced. ](https://www.nfl.com/news/</news/panthers-re-sign-backup-qb-andy-dalton-to-two-year-deal> \\\"Panthers re-sign backup QB Andy Dalton to two-year deal\\\") [ ![](https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/league/vukfz5hoy2tx5qlccozg.jpg) news  NFL news roundup: Saints hiring Scott Tolzien as QBs coach; Bengals extend P Ryan Rehkow  NFL.com keeps you up to date with all of the latest league news from around the NFL.

Just honest. Guys didn\\'t know how to win; guys didn\\'t know how to prepare. They didn\\'t take themselves serious to realize we was 2-14. There was a lot of 2-14 in the mentality of those guys.\\\" Those comments didn\\'t sit well with Smith, the most productive receiver ever to wear a Panthers uniform and one of 15 finalists for the 2025 Pro Football Hall of Fame. A member of that 2010 team, he made his feelings clear through several posts on X. \\\"53 man locker room -- 1 = 52 losers.

Newton said he has \\\"no quarrel\\\" with Smith and understands why he took exception. But he wasn\\'t backing down. \\\"I\\'m not specifically talking about those guys,\\\" Newton said on his podcast. \\\"I\\'m talking about the culture that was there prior to me coming into the locker room -- and it was a losers\\' mentality.\\\" Newton said the Panthers still had it his first two seasons when they went 6-10 and 7-9. He also said he needed to learn how to win in the NFL. Things started to come together in 2013, when Carolina went 12-4 before losing to the [San Francisco 49ers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43845938/</nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers>) in the divisional round. The 2015 team went 15-1 and made the Super Bowl, with Newton winning league MVP honors that season. \\\"Is it me saying that, \\'Oh when I came, I made everything [better]?\\'\\\" he said. \\\"No. I never said that. What I said was if you\\'re getting drafted No. 1, you\\'re going to a bad football team. That\\'s facts. And that\\'s the point that I was trying to tell Travis Hunter. You see what I\\'m saying? For me, everybody is so taken aback, like, \\'Oh, Cam said this.\\' Bro, it\\'s the truth.

interviews Wednesday. [San Francisco 49ers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers>) director of scouting and football operations Josh Williams, [Los Angeles Rams](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams>) director of scouting strategy James Gladstone, [Chicago Bears](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears>) assistant general manager Ian Cunningham and [Green Bay Packers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers>) vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan were picked from a group of 10 candidates that interviewed virtually. Current Jaguars interim general manager Ethan Waugh, who took over the job when the Jaguars and former GM Trent Baalke parted ways Jan. 22, is also a finalist. A league source told ESPN last week that the Jaguars hoped to make a hire by the end of the upcoming week.\n## Editor\\'s Picks [The Jaguars have their coaching staff in place ... now what?](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/story/_/id/43831602/jaguars-gm-search-coaching-staff-place-next>) [Jags president Lamping gets contract extension](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/story/_/id/43796875/jaguars-president-mark-lamping-inks-extension-2030-season>) [Offseason guide for every eliminated NFL team: Key free agents, draft outlook, priorities and predictions](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/insider/story/_/id/43235642/2025-nfl-offseason-guide-every-team-priorities-free-agents-draft-predictions>)\nNone of the five finalists have been a general manager before, which means the team\\'s three main decision-makers will be rookies. Liam Coen is a first-time head coach, and Tony Boselli is just weeks into his tenure as the team\\'s executive vice president of football operations. Williams has been with San Francisco\\'s scouting department since 2011, moving from a pro personnel scout to an area scout to a national scout. He was promoted to director of scouting and football operations in 2024. Gladstone has been with the Rams since 2016, starting as a senior assistant to general manager Les Snead before working as the player personnel coordinator, the director of scouting and the director of scouting strategy, a position he has held for the past three years. Cunningham has been the assistant to Bears general manager Ryan Poles for the past three seasons. Prior to that, he spent a year as [Philadelphia](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles>)\\'s director of player personnel, two years as the Eagles\\' assistant director of player personnel and two years as the Eagles\\' director of college scouring. Cunningham was an area scout with [Baltimore](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/</nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens>) for four years after spending four years as the Ravens\\' player personnel assistant, where he worked with former general manager Ozzie Newsome. Sullivan has been with the Packers since 2004, beginning his career in the football operations department. He has been a regional scout, the director of college scouting and the co-director of player personnel and has been the vice president of player personnel for the past three years. Baalke hired Waugh to be the Jaguars\\' assistant general manager in 2022. Before that, Waugh spent 19 years with San Francisco, beginning his career as a personnel assistant in 2004. He also worked as a regional scout, a senior personnel assistant, the senior player personnel coordinator, the director of college scouting and football systems, and the vice president of player personnel.\n* [Terms of Use](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/<https:/disneytermsofuse.com/german/>) * [Privacy Policy](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/<https:/privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/current-privacy-policy/>) * [Interest-Based Ads](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/<http:/preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=disney01&aid=espnemea01&type=espn>) * [EU Privacy Rights](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/<https:/privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/current-privacy-policy/privacy-notice/>) * [Cookie Policy](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/<https:/privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/en/current-privacy-policy/cookies-policy/>) * [Manage Privacy Preferences](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43864627/<#>) \u00a9 ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

This is desperate tabloid fodder.\\\"\\nLast week, Tucker\\'s lawyers provided a sworn declaration from the owner of Baltimore Spa & Salon saying she never received complaints about him or suspected he engaged in any misconduct. Therapists from the spa told the Banner they did not report his behavior to supervisors because they feared they would lose their jobs.\\nAllegations against Tucker first surfaced Jan. 30, when the Banner spoke to six massage therapists about his behavior. Tucker\\'s conduct, according to the article, caused some therapists to refuse to work with him again and resulted in two spas banning him from returning.\\nTucker\\'s lawyers said Tucker has never been banned from the two spas. They also denied allegations of inappropriate behavior, telling the Banner it\\'s speculative and \\\"impossible to prove.\\\"\\nOn Feb. 1, three additional massage therapists accused Tucker of misconduct. One woman produced what she said was an internal report from 2015 about her experiences with Tucker.\\nShe told the Banner that Tucker stroked her inner thigh during a massage, would expose himself and left what she believed to be ejaculate on the table.

However, one of the best offensive linemen in the NFL isn't ready to ride off into the sunset. Following another Super Bowl title, Johnson posted on social media Sunday that he's \"looking forward to [many more years to come](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/x.com/LaneJohnson65/status/1891203735331705225>)\" while sharing a video of his championship parade speech. > Nothing but love the past 12 years & I'm looking forward to many more years to come - love y'all Philly! \ud83e\udd85\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 [pic.twitter.com/MMgemjZ9yp](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/t.co/MMgemjZ9yp>) > \u2014 Lane Johnson (@LaneJohnson65) [February 16, 2025](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/twitter.com/LaneJohnson65/status/1891203735331705225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>) The six-time Pro Bowler has keyed two Lombardi runs in Philly as a rock on the right side of the offensive line. Johnson's athleticism and technique remain unfailing even as he gets long in the tooth -- turning 35 in May. In 15 regular season games in 2024, Johnson allowed just 10 QB pressures, the fewest among qualifying offensive tackles, and gave up zero sacks and a single QB hit, per PFF. It would be natural to consider riding into the sunset after spearheading a second Super Bowl, but Johnson has plenty of gas left in the tank for a run at a third ring. After re-doing his contract in 2023, Johnson has two more years left on his deal. Given the tackle's age and Howie Roseman's eye toward getting ahead of succession, it wouldn't be a surprise if Philly adds a young OT for Johnson to groom, as it once did with [Jason Kelce](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/www.nfl.com/players/jason-kelce/>)-[Cam Jurgens](https://www.nfl.com/news/<https:/www.nfl.com/players/cam-jurgens/>).\n## Related Content [ ![](https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/league/z9lur6t6wzsomdailhit.jpg) news  Matt Eberflus on focus of 2025 Cowboys defense: 'We will take the ball away'  Addressing reporters Tuesday, former Chicago Bears head coach and new Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus forecast an exciting and opportunistic unit. ](https://www.nfl.com/news/</news/matt-eberflus-on-focus-of-2025-cowboys-defense-we-will-take-the-ball-away> \"Matt Eberflus on focus of 2025 Cowboys defense: 'We will take the ball away'\") [ ![](https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/league/byb6lyjwogjmei7zo441.jpg) news  Panthers re-sign backup QB Andy Dalton to two-year deal  Veteran quarterback Andy Dalton is returning to the Panthers on a two-year deal, the team announced. ](https://www.nfl.com/news/</news/panthers-re-sign-backup-qb-andy-dalton-to-two-year-deal> \"Panthers re-sign backup QB Andy Dalton to two-year deal\") [ ![](https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/league/vukfz5hoy2tx5qlccozg.jpg) news  NFL news roundup: Saints hiring Scott Tolzien as QBs coach; Bengals extend P Ryan Rehkow  NFL.com keeps you up to date with all of the latest league news from around the NFL.
